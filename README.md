# **MyFirst NFT Marketplace**

**MyFirst NFT Marketplace** is a smart contract-based application built using **Solidity** and the **Foundry** toolkit. It provides a decentralized platform for creating, buying, selling, and auctioning NFTs. Designed with a focus on efficiency and security, this project leverages the powerful features of Foundry to streamline development and testing.

## **Features**

This NFT marketplace supports the following functionalities:  

- **Mint:** Create new NFTs with ease.  
- **Buy:** Instantly purchase available NFTs.  
- **Sale:** List NFTs for sale with a defined price.  
- **Auction:** Start an auction to sell NFTs to the highest bidder.  
- **Bid:** Place bids during an auction.  
- **Cancel Auction:** Cancel active auctions and retain ownership of the NFT.  
- **Stop Auction:** End an auction early, settling it with the current highest bidder.

## **Built With**

The project uses **Foundry**, a modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust. Foundry consists of:  

- **Forge:** A testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts, similar to Truffle and Hardhat.  
- **Cast:** A versatile command-line tool for interacting with EVM contracts, sending transactions, and retrieving chain data.  
- **Anvil:** A local Ethereum development node, equivalent to Ganache or Hardhat Network.  
- **Chisel:** A fast Solidity REPL for rapid testing and exploration.
